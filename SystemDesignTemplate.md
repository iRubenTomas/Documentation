# System Design Problem Solving Template

Solving system design problems is challenging due to inherent ambiguities in defining system requirements and making decisions with incomplete information.

## Introduction
This document presents a structured template to approach system design problems effectively, with emphasis on clarity, scalability, and efficiency.

## Approach to System Design Problems

To tackle system design interviews or real-world problems, follow this systematic methodology:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Clarify the problem statement and gather detailed requirements.
- Identify the scope, goals, and constraints of the system.

### Step 2: High-Level Design
- Develop a high-level architecture that breaks down the system into manageable components.
- Sketch out the main components and their interactions.

### Step 3: Detailed Component Design
- Dive deeper into each component, defining its responsibilities and how it integrates with others.
- Address scalability, reliability, and performance considerations.

### Step 4: Evaluate Trade-offs
- Discuss potential bottlenecks and trade-offs in the design.
- Consider factors like cost, performance, and maintainability.

### Step 5: Scalability Enhancements
- Plan for scalability improvements such as using load balancers, caching strategies, and database sharding.

## 13 Key Concepts for System Design

Here are 13 essential concepts to use when designing a system:

### 0. Load Balancer
Efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much load.

### 1. API Gateway
Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, providing a unified interface to various microservices.

### 2. Cache
Stores recently accessed data for speedy retrieval, reducing the load on databases and improving response times.

### 3. CDN (Content Delivery Network)
Stores static content closer to users to minimize latency and speed up content delivery.

### 4. Distributed File Storage
Ensures data is redundantly stored across multiple locations for fault tolerance and easy access.

### 5. Search Index
Utilizes platforms like Elasticsearch for scalable and fast search capabilities across large datasets.

### 6. Notification Service
Handles the delivery of messages or alerts to users across different platforms and devices.

### 7. Data Processing Systems
Analyzes large volumes of data using systems like Hadoop and Spark for scalable computational operations.

### 8. Distributed Scheduler
Orchestrates and manages the execution of distributed tasks across various computing resources.

### 9. Metadata Server
Stores information about the structure of data, enabling efficient access and management.

### 10. Block Server
Manages the storage blocks in distributed file systems, aiding in data replication and retrieval.

### 11. Distributed Logging
Collects logs from various services in a centralized manner for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 12. Replication and Partitioning
Ensures data availability and durability, while partitioning helps in scaling databases by distributing data across different nodes.

## Conclusion
Following this structured approach and understanding key system design concepts can greatly enhance our ability to design robust and efficient systems.
