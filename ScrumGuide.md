# Simple Guide to Scrum and Its Ceremonies

Scrum is a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a team works as a unit to reach a common goal. It enables teams to self-organize and make changes quickly, in accordance with agile principles.

## Key Scrum Ceremonies

### 1. Sprint Planning
This meeting kicks off the sprint. The team decides what to complete in the coming sprint and plans how to achieve this.

- **Duration**: Usually two hours per week of sprint duration.
- **Participants**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team.
- **Goal**: Create a Sprint Backlog that outlines the tasks for the sprint.

### 2. Daily Scrum
A quick, daily meeting where team members synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

- **Duration**: 15 minutes.
- **Participants**: Development Team (Scrum Master and Product Owner may attend but not actively participate).
- **Goal**: Update the team on progress and plan the day's work.

### 3. Sprint Review
A meeting at the end of the sprint where the team presents what they completed during the sprint.

- **Duration**: Typically one hour per week of sprint duration.
- **Participants**: Scrum Team and stakeholders.
- **Goal**: Show the work done and gather feedback to adjust for the next sprint.

### 4. Sprint Retrospective
This occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. The team discusses what went well, what could be improved, and plans improvements for the next Sprint.

- **Duration**: Usually 45 minutes for a two-week sprint.
- **Participants**: Scrum Team.
- **Goal**: Reflect on the sprint and plan for improvements in the next.

## Additional Elements
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the Scrum process and resolves impediments.
- **Product Owner**: Owns the product backlog and ensures the team knows the priorities.
- **Development Team**: Cross-functional group who do the actual work (develop, test, design, etc.).

## Summary
Scrum is built around continuous improvement and rapid response to change. Each ceremony helps the team focus, collaborate, and adapt throughout the project lifecycle.
